    -Two files inside called apiroutes.js and htmlroutes.js
    -apiroute: dependencies, route to note from home page, route to add notes, route to delete notes 
    -htmlroute: created the routes from the home page to the notes page and the notes page to the home page
4. Added a server.js file
    -Added Express Dependencie
    -Set up the express app to create an actual url
    -Added routes between each page
    -app.listen to make it so the app listens to the server
